*Reverse Engineering stuff for the linux version of Devil Daggers.*

#+TOC: headlines 2

* Description

The purpose of this project is to learn about reverse engineering, not cheating.

I made an article for my blog explaining the reversing process, if you are
interested, make sure to [[https://8dcc.github.io/reversing/devildaggers.html][check it out]].

This project uses my own [[https://github.com/8dcc/detour-lib][detour hooking library]]. For more information about
detour hooking, see my [[https://8dcc.github.io/programming/detour-hooking.html][blog entry]].

* Features

All features can be changed at compile-time from [[file:src/include/settings.h][settings.h]]. I haven't added a
menu because this is a small project for learning about reversing and for
tinkering with the game.

All settings except god-mode are "detected", meaning your score won't be
submitted. Although this can be easily avoided (have a look at
=verse2::VERSE::step_ui()=), I decided not to bypass it for now.
